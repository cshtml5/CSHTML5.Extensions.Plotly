### HOW IS IT IMPLEMENTED?

It is implemented using a C#-based wrapper around the JavaScript library "Plotly.js". With such a "wrapper", it is possible to use the JavaScript library directly from C#, as if it was a C# library.

Documentation of this concept of "wrapper" can be found at:
http://cshtml5.com/links/how-to-create-extensions.aspx
and
